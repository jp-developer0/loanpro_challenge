Indide this folder you can find React frontend and Java Backend.
Each of them have its readme with instructions to start and use.

Backend is complete with all requeriments, you can test it with postman.

Frontend is visually complete with all sections of the application.

Connection between them is missing.

Thanks for the opportunity.
